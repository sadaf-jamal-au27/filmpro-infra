# üöÄ GitHub Actions OIDC Setup Complete!

Your AWS OIDC authentication for GitHub Actions is now properly configured. Here's what you need to do next to complete the setup:

## ‚úÖ What's Already Done:
- ‚úÖ AWS OIDC Identity Provider created
- ‚úÖ IAM Role `GitHubActionsRole-FilmPro-Infra` created with proper permissions
- ‚úÖ Trust policy configured for your repository
- ‚úÖ GitHub Actions workflow updated with OIDC configuration

## üîß Next Steps:

### 1. Add GitHub Secret (REQUIRED)
Go to your GitHub repository and add the AWS Role ARN as a secret:

**Repository URL:** https://github.com/sadaf-jamal-au27/filmpro-infra/settings/secrets/actions

**Secret Details:**
- **Name:** `AWS_ROLE_ARN`
- **Value:** `arn:aws:iam::008099619893:role/GitHubActionsRole-FilmPro-Infra`

### 2. Create GitHub Environments
Go to: https://github.com/sadaf-jamal-au27/filmpro-infra/settings/environments

Create two environments:
- **staging** (for develop branch deployments)
- **production** (for master branch deployments with approval)

### 3. Configure Branch Protection Rules
Go to: https://github.com/sadaf-jamal-au27/filmpro-infra/settings/branches

Set up protection for:
- **master** branch (require PR reviews, status checks)
- **develop** branch (require status checks)

### 4. Test the CI/CD Pipeline

1. **Test with a Pull Request:**
```bash
git checkout -b feature/test-cicd
echo "# Test" >> README.md
git add README.md
git commit -m "test: verify CI/CD pipeline"
git push origin feature/test-cicd
```

2. **Create PR** from `feature/test-cicd` to `develop`
3. **Verify** that the workflow runs and posts plan comments
4. **Merge** to `develop` to test staging deployment
5. **Create PR** from `develop` to `master` to test production deployment

## üîç Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues:

1. **Run the troubleshooter:**
```bash
./scripts/troubleshoot-oidc.sh
```

2. **Check GitHub Actions logs** in your repository
3. **Verify the secret** was added correctly
4. **Ensure environments** are properly configured
